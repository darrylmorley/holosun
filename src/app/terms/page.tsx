        </p>
        <p>
          4.6 If there is no one to accept the order on the scheduled delivery date the goods may be
          returned to the warehouse and we reserve the right to charge you an additional re-delivery
          charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.7 Please check the goods on delivery - any goods found to be missing or damaged should

        <p>
          4.9 Sometimes, for reasons beyond our control we may be prevented from delivering your
          goods as planned. These might include things such as accidents, breakdowns, fire, flood,
          storm, severe weather, acts of god, war, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage or the
          default of our suppliers. We are not responsible where this causes a delay or failure in

          5. Cancellation and returns
        </h3>
        <p>
          5.1 This policy does not apply to goods ordered by businesses which are exempt from the
          Distance Selling Regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.2 You can cancel your contract at any time up to 14 days after the day of delivery. To
          do this, please e-mail, call or write to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.3 You do not have to give any reason for cancellation. However, a brief explanation will
          help us to improve the service we offer to customers in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.4 If you cancel, you must return the goods within 14 days of cancellation, complete with
          the original packaging to us and/or our supplier (or any other UK address specified by
          us), at your own expense. You must ensure that the goods are packaged adequately to
          protect against damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.5 You may properly examine the goods for 14 days as you would do had you visited our
          showroom, however you may not return any goods that have been installed unless they are
          faulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.6 If you fail to take reasonable care of the goods before they are returned to us, and
          this results in damage or deterioration, we will charge you for the reduction in value.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.7 We will refund all monies paid to us by you minus any postage / carriage within 30
          days, less any costs due under this contract. Please see point 5.1 for exemptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.8 We reserve the right not to replace any item that has been fitted, as we will deem
          this acceptance of the goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.9 We will not be held liable for gunsmith fees or any other professional persons fees
          due to late, damaged or lost deliveries.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.10 We are not liable for any loss of earnings due to late, incorrect or lost deliveries.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.11 We reserve the right to refuse replacements on any damaged items reported to us
          outside of two working days from delivery. This cancellation policy does not affect your
          legal rights - for example, if goods are faulty or misdescribed.

          6. Faulty Goods / Guarantee
        </h3>
        <p>
          6.1 If there is a problem with the goods, please notify us by phone, email or in writing
          providing details of the problem. In addition, you must provide us with a digital
          photograph of the problem. We will deal with the matter in accordance with your legal
          rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.2 All goods are covered by a manufacturer’s warranty against faulty workmanship and
          materials, subject to the terms and conditions of that warranty.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.3 The manufacturer’s warranty is provided in addition to the rights that the law says
          you have as a consumer and accordingly, your statutory rights are not affected.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.4 If an exchange is necessary, this will be arranged without unreasonable delay and
          without charge. Replacement goods will not be dispatched until the original goods have
          been received at our store and checked. The cost of returning goods to us is your
          responsibility. If the goods are not faulty, we will return them to you, however you will
          be required to cover our reasonable postage costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.5 If an item is no longer available we will offer an alternative. However, our liability
          will be to replace the faulty goods only and we are unable to guarantee an exact match. In
          this instance, you will have the option of a refund on the items under the warranty claim.
        </p>
